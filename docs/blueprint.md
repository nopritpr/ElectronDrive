# **App Name**: Electron Drive

## Core Features:

- Live Vehicle Telemetry: Displays real-time data, from a conceptual model, including speed, battery level, power consumption, and drive mode, using simulated inputs instead of true sensor readings.
- Predictive Range Estimation: Employs a machine learning model to estimate remaining range based on driving style, historical data, climate control settings, and weather data to provide better range estimates.
- Adaptive Driving Recommendations: Provides proactive recommendations, as a tool, such as adjusting drive mode, A/C usage, or speed, based on user habits and predicted range to enhance energy efficiency.
- Charging Pattern Analysis: Analyzes the user's charging behavior and makes smart recommendations to improve long-term battery health
- SOH Forecast: Forecasts future battery health with machine learning to provide long term planning of battery end of life or replacement
- Driver Profiling: Profiles driving style by learning user characteristics, and helps promote safer and more efficient vehicle operation.
- Driving Style Insights: Captures specific elements from trips to promote improvements to user habits to enhance driving dynamics.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 75%, 50%) / RGB(30, 144, 255), a vibrant blue to convey technology and forward movement, evoking feelings of trust and reliability.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 20%) / RGB(51, 61, 77), a desaturated dark blue providing contrast and enhancing readability.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) / RGB(24, 171, 171), a teal, chosen to add contrast with the primary color.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, to bring in computerized, techy, scientific feeling.  Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, to provide a neutral user experience.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different functions, driving modes, and data points, keeping the design uncluttered.
- Maintain a consistent grid layout across all tabs to ensure information is easily digestible. Prioritize the visibility of key metrics (speed, battery level) through strategic placement.
